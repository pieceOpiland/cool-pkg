# pieceopiland-cool-pkg

This just a playground for myself and playing with publishing an NPM package.
I might continue to try and work more with the NPM environment, but this is
just a preliminary step. I might do some more stuff, we'll see. Only time will
tell.

## So, what is this?

This honestly should be ignored by anyone. As I mentioned before, there isn't
really anything to this module. I'm just playing around with NPM to see what I
can do with it.
